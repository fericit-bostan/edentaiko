                Eden Aoba Taiko was formed in 1997 to promote the Japanese music art of Taiko drumming under the direction of Masa Fukuizumi. 
                The group started with 6 people and increased to 50 by the end of the year. Members' ages range from 6 year-old to more than 80. 
                We believe that Taiko is for everyone, no matter what your age.

              The focus of the classes is to have a fun drumming with others.
              Also, drumming is a self-expression among others.

              Fee for a session is $30.00. Bring your own bachi (sticks) or I have some for sale.

        </h2>
        <p>
          <span>Taiko (太鼓?) means "drum" in Japanese. Outside Japan, the word is often used to refer to any of the various 
          Japanese drums (和太鼓, "wa-daiko", "Japanese drum", in Japanese) and to the relatively recent art-form of ensemble 
          taiko drumming. </span>
