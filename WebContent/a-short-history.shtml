                  Eden Aoba Taiko was formed in 1997 to promote the Japanese music art of Taiko drumming under the direction of Masa Fukuizumi. 
                  The group started with 6 people and increased to 50 by the end of the year. Members' ages range from 6 year-old to more than 80. 
                  We believe that Taiko is for everyone, no matter what your age.

            <p>  
              <span>
                  Our Taiko philosophy is to have a fun drumming and enhance self-expression, self-esteem, and self-confidence. 
                  It is also our goal to enrich disciplines such as respect, harmony, and unity through drumming with others.

                  Learning taiko takes a time. There are no short cuts or simply ways. It is very similar to life; ups and downs, bends and straights. It requires a patience.
                  Taiko is a mental training with physical strength. So long as you practice, you will get better; and then comes fun.
