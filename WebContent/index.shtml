            <p>
              <span>It has been a 15 years since I started
                teaching taiko, and 5 years since the 10 year
                anniversary concert. It went really well and we had
                great fun. Everyone worked hard and two groups from
                Japan made it an even greater event.</span>
              </p>
              <p>  
              <span>This year, our 15th year conincides with the
                one year anniversary of Earthquake/Tsunami disaster in
                Japan. There are still lot of issues faced by the people
                victimized by the disaster.</span>

            <span>A Short History</span>
          </h2>
          <p>
            <span>
                Eden Aoba Taiko was formed in 1997 to promote the Japanese music art of Taiko drumming under the direction of Masa Fukuizumi. 
                The group started with 6 people and increased to 50 by the end of the year. Members' ages range from 6 year-old to more than 80. 
                We believe that Taiko is for everyone, no matter what your age.             
            </span>
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>  
            <span>
                Our Taiko philosophy is to have a fun drumming and enhance self-expression, self-esteem, and self-confidence. 
                It is also our goal to enrich disciplines such as respect, harmony, and unity through drumming with others.
            </span>
          </p>  
          <br/>
          <p>
            <span>    
                Learning taiko takes a time. There are no short cuts or simply ways. It is very similar to life; ups and downs, bends and straights. It requires a patience.
                Taiko is a mental training with physical strength. So long as you practice, you will get better; and then comes fun.

        <p>
          <span>
          My home town is called 'Tome-City'. It is a small farming region about 2 hours North from Sendai, which is the capital city of Miyagi Prefecture, 
          and the largest city in the Tōhoku Region.
          The city was founded in 1600 by the daimyo Date Masamune, an outstanding tactician and well known for his missing eye and was often called dokuganryū (独眼竜), 
          or the "one-eyed dragon".

          <span>What is Taiko</span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span>Taiko (太鼓?) means "drum" in Japanese. Outside Japan, the word is often used to refer to any of the various 
          Japanese drums (和太鼓, "wa-daiko", "Japanese drum", in Japanese) and to the relatively recent art-form of ensemble 
          taiko drumming. </span>
