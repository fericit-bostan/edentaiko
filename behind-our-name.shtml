              My home town is called 'Tome-City'. It is a small farming region about 2 hours North from Sendai which is the capital city of Miyagi Prefecture, Japan, 
              and the largest city in the Tōhoku Region.
              The city was founded in 1600 by the daimyo Date Masamune, an outstanding tactician and well known for his missing eye. 
              Date was often called dokuganryū (独眼竜), or the "one-eyed dragon".
              Sendai is well known by its nickname, the City of Trees (杜の都 Mori no Miyako). 
              There was a castle constructed in Sendai atop Mount Aoba and is situated on a plateau overlooking the city of Sendai across the Hirose River. This plateau is joined to the backspine of northern Honshu, the Ōū Mountain Range on its western side, 
              and is protected by deep forest to its west, and sheer cliffs on its southern and eastern sides.
              The castle was named from this notion: the castle in the woods/trees/leaves.

                Sendai was considered to be one of Japan's greenest cities, mostly because of its great numbers of trees and plants. 
                Sendai became known as The City of Trees before World War II as the Sendai han encouraged residents to plant trees in their gardens.
